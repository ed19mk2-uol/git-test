If cost and sustainability were not factors, every business would operate a standalone data center — meaning a detached facility purpose-built for housing servers.

But in the real world, many businesses that need to operate IT infrastructure can't justify the investment for building a full-fledged data center. So they do the next best thing: They set up server rooms inside multi-purpose buildings.

Now, it would be easy to treat on-site server rooms as an outdated or risky way to operate IT equipment. But there's no shame in relying on an old-fashioned server room. In fact, for some businesses, it may be a better approach than building a traditional data center or paying for colocation space.

With that reality in mind, let's talk about the pros and cons of server rooms compared with conventional data centers, and when to choose which.

What Is a Server Room?
When I refer to server rooms, I mean rooms that are filled with servers but that are not part of a conventional data center. You find server rooms inside facilities built primarily for other purposes — most often, office buildings where staff of all types work.

Server rooms don't require special equipment apart from cooling systems (which, in many cases, is the standard air conditioning system installed in whichever building houses the server room) and enough electricity to power however many servers will live in the room.
